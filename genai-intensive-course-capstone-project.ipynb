    "# GenAI Intensive Course Capstone Project : Terms of Service Translator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading the long and complicated terms of service on websites can be overwhelming for most people. These documents are full of legal language that many users don't read or fully understand, which can lead to uncertainty about the specifics of the service they are using, what they are agreeing to, and the responsibilities of the provider. **This project tackles that problem by creating a smart \"Terms of Service Translator.\"** It uses Gemini AI to turn complex legal text into simple, easy-to-understand summaries. The translated texts are written in plain English and made more approachable with helpful emoji.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the capabilities of this translator, a sample Terms of Service document has been created for a fictitious company called \"Dig-A-Hole.\" This whimsical example details a service where customers can engage in the activity of digging holes in designated areas of a field for recreational exercise and stress relief, with options for subscription. This sample terms of service document has been saved in a PDF file, which Gemini AI is then used to read and process. The goal is to translate the formal legal language of this document into a clear and friendly summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was incorporated by the following approach along with demonstration of Gen AI capabilities in ().\n",
    "\n",
    "* A sample Terms of Service document was created for the fictitious \"Dig-A-Hole\" company, detailing their stress-relief digging service, and then saved as a PDF.\n",
    "* The necessary Google API key was set up to enable access to the Gen AI models.\n",
    "* A suitable Gemini model was selected for effective language processing.\n",
    "* The PDF document was then processed using Gemini AI with a carefully designed prompt to extract and summarize the key legal terms into plain, accessible English (Leveraging Gemini for **Document Understanding**).\n",
    "* Few-shot prompting with illustrative examples was employed to guide Gemini in incorporating relevant and helpful emojis into the translations (**Few-shot Prompting**).\n",
    "* The output was structured using JSON format to establish a direct and clear link between the original legal terms and their corresponding simplified translations (**JSON Mode**).\n",
    "* Gemini AI was utilized again to rigorously evaluate the quality of the translated output based on predefined metrics, specific evaluation criteria, and a detailed rating rubric (**Gen AI Evaluation**).\n",
    "* Interactivity was implemented in the translated Terms of Service by using Embeddings and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This allows users to ask specific questions about the terms and receive relevant, context-aware answers (**Embeddings** and **RAG**).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates a practical application of Gen AI in making legal documents more accessible and user-friendly."
