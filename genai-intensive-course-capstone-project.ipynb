    "Reading the long and complicated terms of service on websites can be overwhelming for most people. These documents are full of legal language that many users don't read or fully understand, which can lead to uncertainty about the specifics of the service they are using, what they are agreeing to, and the responsibilities of the provider. This project tackles that problem by creating a smart \"Terms of Service Translator.\" It uses Gemini AI to turn complex legal text into simple, easy-to-understand summaries. The translated texts are written in plain English and made more approachable with helpful emoji.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this project, I have written a sample terms of service document for a fictitious company called \"Dig-A-Hole.\" This company provides a service where customers can engage in the activity of digging holes in designated areas of a field for recreational exercise and stress relief, with options for subscription. This sample terms of service document has been saved in a PDF file, which Gemini AI is then used to read and process. The goal is to translate the formal legal language of this document into a clear and friendly summary."
